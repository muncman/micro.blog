  <p>I collect knives. Sort of. Mostly pocket knives.</p>

<p>I am not a “collector” in the investment sense; I have few knives that cost more $200 a piece (and there are knife makers with average prices in the thousands). I also use every knife I buy; none sit on a pedestal or display case (not even with a price tag still on it, Nigel Tufnel-style). What do I use them for? Mostly opening mail, packages, clipping hanging threads, whittling.</p>

<p>I like handmade knives, but mostly buy production ones. My most frequent brands are probably Spyderco, Benchmade, and CRKT, though this changes over time — brands have ups and downs in quality and innovation.</p>

<p>I’ve carried a pocket knife most days (airports, some events, and jury duty notwithstanding) since I was single-digits old. I remember which ones I had with me on special occasions. It is a mainstay for me. Knife, wallet, phone, keys.</p>

<p>Phone is the newest addition to that EDC base, and it may soon consume the roles of wallet and keys, but the knife will carry on.</p>
