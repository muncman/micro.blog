  <p>I’ve been trying out <a href="http://supertop.co/">Supertop</a>’s <a href="http://supertop.co/castro/">Castro 3</a>, and <strong>it is nice!</strong> Looks nice, feels nice, performs nice. <em>But nice enough for me to switch from <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a>?</em></p>

<p>I currently have some of my own uploads (<a href="https://revolutionspodcastfundraiser.com/collections/thor-episodes">Appendix 2 of The History of Rome</a>) queued up in Overcast (which is a Premium feature). I don’t think I can do that with Castro, though maybe they’ll implement something like that someday (or, maybe someday <a href="https://marco.org/">Marco</a> will yank that feature. :)</p>

<p>I often listen to my Overcast queue on the web via an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-specific_browser">SSB</a> on desktop (available because I have not ‘converted to anonymous’ in the app). I don’t see any way to log in to Castro.fm to do the same, though. Since the only ID-related/sync-ish option seems to be to enable an iCloud backup (SOME-GUID.castrobackup), perhaps they could do something with CloudKit down the road for this?</p>

<p>Another place I process my episode queue is on my iPad. While the aforementioned Castro backup does get nicely processed at launch on iPad, the app interface is scaled (side note: the backup was also not up to date when I tried it). Overcast, on the other hand, takes advantage of landscape orientation and multitasking.</p>

<p>Given these differences, I’ll be sticking with Overcast for the time being.</p>

<p>Footnote/Photo:  Speaking of time, at the bottom of the settings screen in Overcast it says how much time <em>Smart Speed</em> has saved me. 193 hours is nothing to sneeze at!</p>
