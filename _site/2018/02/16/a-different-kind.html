  <p>I came across independent music label <a href="https://hypnoticdirgerecords.bandcamp.com/music">Hypnotic Dirge Records</a>’ account on Bandcamp via “Canadian prairie doom metal” band <a href="https://hypnoticdirgerecords.bandcamp.com/album/iris">Alters of Grief</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Side note: there are <em>endless</em> sub-genres in metal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Saskatoon-based label says it supports “underground black metal, death-doom, experimental and more…” What was noteworthy to me was that you could not only by their entire 77 release digital back catalog for $25CAD, but that they offer <a href="https://hypnoticdirgerecords.bandcamp.com/subscribe">subscription plans</a>.</p>

<p>This may be common on Bandcamp for all I know. I’m buying from the site more often lately, but this is the first time I’ve noticed something like it.</p>

<p>I like the idea, though. It should help sustain the small label, increase exposure for their full roster of talent, and includes the subscriber in a way that gives them wide-open and ongoing access to music, new and old.</p>

<p>What would something like this look like for larger labels? Could they each have their own focused version of Spotify? Or would they just turn it into another BMG/Columbia House Music Club? Some, like Sony, have tried this, of course. I suspect it might work better for genre-specialized labels than for general, mass-media labels.</p>

<p>I prefer supporting artists as directly as I can, but for artists working a country away from me, supporting their indie label doesn’t seem like a bad way to go.</p>
