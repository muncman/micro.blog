  <p>As you may or may not know, I very much prefer to work remotely. I don‚Äôt dislike co-located work, but I value more highly being home with the kids in the summer and when they get home from school. Also, while I enjoy driving, I loathe commuting. Beyond all of that, I believe that there are numerous advantages to distributed teams ‚Äìfor both the business and the individual‚Äì that are often overlooked by those who have not worked this way.</p>

<p><em>It‚Äôs certainly not the only way to be successful, but it can be a good one.</em></p>

<p>Accordingly, I haven‚Äôt gone into an office more than twice per week since 2012, and even worked remotely at times before that. Over that time, I‚Äôve seen poor distributed teams, of course, but I‚Äôve more frequently seen co-located teams with poor performance.</p>

<p>My hope is that distributed teams will become more generally embraced for knowledge work going forward, so when today I was contacted about a job opportunity, the fact that it is prominently marked as ‚Äònon-remote‚Äô struck me frustratingly hilarious given these excerpts from the posting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We believe work is not a place, but rather a thing you do. Our technology revolves around this core philosophy. We are relentlessly committed to helping people work and play from anywhere, on any device.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We empower the original mobile device:  YOU!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Ä¶is a cloud company that enables mobile workstyles.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Ä¶by allowing people to work whenever, wherever, and however they choose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further, Wikipedia has a page that says this company ‚Äú‚Ä¶creates software that allows the individuals of an enterprise to work and collaborate remotely‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>But still they shun internal distributed teams?</strong></p>
