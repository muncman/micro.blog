  <p>I started this reply directly in Twitter, but then decided to post this here since I’m not really a fan of Tweetstorms. Still, I left it composed for numbered 140-character-or-less chunks. In the end, I didn’t want to over-compose my reply even though I have more room to do so here. <em>&lt;shrug /&gt;</em></p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> Eric is my friend, but we don’t see eye-to-eye on some things. :) I believe (hope!) he knows that I’m not trying to be belligerent. I enjoy having discussions with people who hold viewpoints different from my own. Of course, Twitter is simply <strong>not good</strong> for this.</p>

<p><a href="http://storify.com/muncman/discussion-from-twitterrific-59bb65f863699d6d1ebd5827">Here’s the conversation so far</a>. You’ll have to read his 12-part response to my own prior reply for the context of what follows.</p>

<p><em><strong>My response:</strong></em></p>

<p>/1 <em>Everything</em> is loaded on Twitter. :)</p>

<p>/2 Your response also uses loaded terms, such as the (mis-)use of ‘gender’ as if it was fully equivalent to biological/assigned ‘sex’.</p>

<p>/3 Or applying a moral judgement on ‘viability’ that is orthogonal to scientific (and other) aspects of the matters you reference.</p>

<p>/4 I lol’d at the characterization of evolution as atheist mythology (as if it is on the same footing as creationism).</p>

<p>/5 The ‘macro’ angle you specify tells me that you probably recognize at least some of the truth of it.</p>

<p>/6 To the original point, the resonance of this topic for me is around human tendency to damage the natural world (or, if you prefer, creation).</p>

<p>/7 Climate change-denial in general, and this administration (and so, too, its party) in particular, are forces for perpetuating this damage.</p>

<p>/8 Is climate change being used as a political tool? Surely. But the politicians should debate <em>that</em>, not deny the science (complex or not).</p>
