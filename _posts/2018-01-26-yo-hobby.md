I collect knives. Sort of. Mostly pocket knives. 

I am not a “collector” in the investment sense; I have few knives that cost more $200 a piece (and there are knife makers with average prices in the thousands). I also use every knife I buy; none sit on a pedestal or display case (not even with a price tag still on it, Nigel Tufnel-style). What do I use them for? Mostly opening mail, packages, clipping hanging threads, whittling. 

I like handmade knives, but mostly buy production ones. My most frequent brands are probably Spyderco, Benchmade, and CRKT, though this changes over time — brands have ups and downs in quality and innovation. 

I’ve carried a pocket knife most days (airports, some events, and jury duty notwithstanding) since I was single-digits old. I remember which ones I had with me on special occasions. It is a mainstay for me. Knife, wallet, phone, keys. 

Phone is the newest addition to that EDC base, and it may soon consume the roles of wallet and keys, but the knife will carry on.
