I came across independent music label [Hypnotic Dirge Records](https://hypnoticdirgerecords.bandcamp.com/music)' account on Bandcamp via "Canadian prairie doom metal" band [Alters of Grief](https://hypnoticdirgerecords.bandcamp.com/album/iris). 

> Side note: there are _endless_ sub-genres in metal. 

The Saskatoon-based label says it supports "underground black metal, death-doom, experimental and more..." What was noteworthy to me was that you could not only by their entire 77 release digital back catalog for $25CAD, but that they offer [subscription plans](https://hypnoticdirgerecords.bandcamp.com/subscribe). 

This may be common on Bandcamp for all I know. I'm buying from the site more often lately, but this is the first time I've noticed something like it. 

I like the idea, though. It should help sustain the small label, increase exposure for their full roster of talent, and includes the subscriber in a way that gives them wide-open and ongoing access to music, new and old. 

What would something like this look like for larger labels? Could they each have their own focused version of Spotify? Or would they just turn it into another BMG/Columbia House Music Club? Some, like Sony, have tried this, of course. I suspect it might work better for genre-specialized labels than for general, mass-media labels. 

I prefer supporting artists as directly as I can, but for artists working a country away from me, supporting their indie label doesn't seem like a bad way to go.
