I wish iOS’ Music.app had more than the most rudimentary playlist management capabilities. Trying to update a playlist or now-playing queue on-the-fly reveals how pathetic it is. 

I’m sure there must be engineers at Apple that would love to rev it up, but it clearly has not been a company priority. Apple isn’t the music-loving company it used to be.
