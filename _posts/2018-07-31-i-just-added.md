I _just_ added these to my collection, and feel like I should mention them to [@joec](https://micro.blog/joec) :: [Trioscapes](https://trioscapes.bandcamp.com/album/digital-dream-sequence) and [Nova Collective](https://novacollectivefusion.bandcamp.com/album/the-further-side). Both are side projects of the bass player from Between the Buried and Me.
