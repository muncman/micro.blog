I just posted these. 

## Facebook  

> I&rsquo;m going to take a little time away from Facebook &mdash; and, to a lesser extent, Twitter and other closed social networks. 

> The next few months will be busier than normal for me; I&rsquo;ll be focused on other things. More than that, I&rsquo;m re-evaluating the cost-benefit of closed-network social media for myself. 

> 6 years ago today I joined App.net. ADN itself isn&rsquo;t around anymore, but the ideas and community are. So, it seems like a fitting day to &lsquo;drop off&rsquo; here. 

## Twitter 

> I&rsquo;m going to start spending less time on Twitter. The next few months will be busy ones for me, anyway.

## Instagram

> I think I&rsquo;m going to start spending less time on Instagram than I have been. I&rsquo;ll be focusing more on open platforms instead. &#x1F918;&#x1F3B8;&#x1F943;

I did not deactivate or delete my accounts. I did not delete posts. I kind of doubt I will ever do that. 

For the time being, I'll still be active here on Micro.blog, on Pnut.io and on Mastodon.social, albeit maybe a bit less often.
