"I&rsquo;ll be straight with you. I want you to cry. To weep. To whimper sweetly. This book is a poignant guide to Ruby. That means code so beautiful that tears are shed. That means gallant tales and somber truths that have you waking up the next morning in the arms of this book. Hugging it tightly to you all the day long. If necessary, fashion a makeshift hip holster for [Why&rsquo;s (Poignant) Guide to Ruby](https://poignant.guide/), so you can always have this book&rsquo;s tender companionship." 

Today is [Whyday](http://wicswac.org/whyday.html).
