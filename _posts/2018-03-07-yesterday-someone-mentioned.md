Yesterday someone mentioned [SGML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language) and [DSSSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Style_Semantics_and_Specification_Language). 

Today a different person mentioned [EBCDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC). 

What year is it?  %)
