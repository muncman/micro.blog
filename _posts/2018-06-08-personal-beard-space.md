Having a chin-beard has shown me that there are three (not two!) kinds of people in this world:  those who ask if they can touch my beard, those who neither ask nor touch (for any number of reasons), and those that simply reach out and touch without hesitation. 

The second category is sometimes horrified by the third, much to my amusement.
