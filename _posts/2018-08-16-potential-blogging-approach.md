I may have a kind of workflow developing here: 

I write something long-ish-form that I'm basically happy with, and post it right away, on the go. Then, later, I go back and add hyperlinks to the post, maybe make minor edits, and correct any typos. 

Is that too “unprofessional” or anything? I feel like I'm more likely to **actually blog things** if I _get it out there_ rather than let it linger in a drafts folder. 

It may be a short term approach, until I get more blogging momentum built up, but for now I suspect the pros outweigh the cons.
