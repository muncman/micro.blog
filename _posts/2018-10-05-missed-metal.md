Another metal show was in town last night, but I couldn't justify going to another one already. Hopefully Unleash the Archers and Striker come back through again soon. 

I'll also be missing After the Burial, Acacia Strain and Erra next week, and I'll likely also have to pass on Cannibal Corpse on 'metal dayâ€™ 11-11.
