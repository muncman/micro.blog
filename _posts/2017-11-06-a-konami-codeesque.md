My iPhone X arrived today. 

The 'automatic' setup from nearby device thing failed repeatedly, so I proceeded manually. No biggie. Then I couldn't perform a restore from back up because the X wasn't on 11.1 yet. Not unusual. So I set the phone up as a new device in order to be able to update iOS so I could then try a restore from backup. 

I've been here before. 

But then I can't open the Settings app. 

Nor any app. 

I try 3D pressing, and the menus come up but don't work. I try VoiceOver - but still no apps will launch. I try Siri - but there's no Siri from the side button. The 'lock' screen is black. I can't get Control Center to show. 

Gotta reboot, right? Well, that doesn't work, either. I double-check the web for how to power down an iPhone X. Yep, I'm doing it right, but it is not working. 

I call Apple Support (getting the IMEI off the box since I can't get into Settings). Only a short wait. They are a little stymied because initially they keep wanting me to check Settings. Ha. 

Then they suggest a technique that was new to me: __Volume Up 1x, then Volume Down 1x, then hold (only) the power button for 20+ seconds__. 

It didn't work the first time, either. But it did the second time! *\o/*
