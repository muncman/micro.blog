I really wish iTunes Match wasn’t such a mess. 

Why? I buy lots of albums. 

I have many hundreds of LPs, cassettes, CDs, and tens of thousands of digital files from Amazon (though I don’t buy music from there anymore), iTunes and, increasingly, Bandcamp. And I’d like them _all_ to be easily and reliably accessible to me. 

Why? I refuse to do streaming services (sorry Spotify, et al). 

Why? Partly because they tend not to have everything I want to listen to, but mostly because I don’t think they treat artists well. 

To me, it is akin to App Store pricing. I think it is _very much the same phenomenon_, actually. 

In fact, to anyone & everyone who ever complained about App Store pricing not being sustainable but who uses a streaming music service (and never or rarely buy tickets + vinyl + merch to compensate), guess what? **You’re part of the problem.**
