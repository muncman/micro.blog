I was casually looking at scheduling tools recently.

I was looking for something that could not only handle the obvious task of making times to meet easier to find and schedule, but which could also support business use cases that I might want to pursue (such as offering design & code review sessions for a fee). [SetMore](https://www.setmore.com/) has been the front runner for me.

The new [WhenWorks](https://when.works/) is enticing, though not as feature-rich. Maybe that simplicity is good, or maybe it will evolve to support additional scenarios. Either way, I&rsquo;m glad to see new competition in this space.&nbsp;

**Update:** I'm not sure if I'll stick with it, and some of the event types are little more than placeholders right now, but [here's my WhenWorks link](https://when.works/muncman).
