Last night I was back at our [local Ruby users group](http://columbusrb.com) for the first time in a long time. I was thrilled to see that a lightning talk &ldquo;series&rdquo; I used to give has been resurrected! 

I've given a dozen or so [_Method of the Month_ presentations](https://www.slideshare.net/muncman/presentations) for Ruby (and JavaScript) in the past, and I&rsquo;ve been thinking of bringing them back for [CocoaHeads](http://buckeyecocoa.org), so this is great inspiration to do it. 

Oh, damn! I just remembered I still have [the domain](http://methodofthemonth.com), though I've done nothing with it yet. &#x1F926;&#x1F3FB;&#x200D;&#x2642;&#xFE0F;
