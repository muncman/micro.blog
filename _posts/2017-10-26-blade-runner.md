The original _Blade Runner_ movie came out in 1982. 16 years later, I arrived in Hong Kong for the first time. It was after midnight, the streets were steamy, people and neon everywhere. It reminded me strongly of Blade Runner. I’ll never forget it. 

I just saw _Blade Runner 2049_ tonight. Now I’m wondering where I’ll go in 2033...
