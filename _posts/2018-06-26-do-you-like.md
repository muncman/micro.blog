The [Alrosa Villa](http://www.alrosavilla.com/) is a metal-friendly venue in Columbus, Ohio. Tonight I’m back here seeing [The Iron Maidens](https://youtu.be/1X6UDcUFlOQ). Once again, the line up includes other local tribute bands, and the Motörhead tribute Orgasmatron just finished. 

What I find interesting, and might like to see become a trend, is that this is an early show. For a weekday, that's nice (and it's still metal, dammit).
