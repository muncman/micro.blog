I'm traveling this week for [a conference](http://360idev.com). I learned, many years ago, that my local backups (which I have in addition to my off-site backups) are less useful if I don't have a way to efficiently get at them while on the road. 

_Once, I had a **total** MBP failure while on a trip._ **Not. Good.** 

Thankfully, I was not far from an Apple Store for a replacement computer at the time, but _my files -- and my client's files&mdash;_ were a different story. 

So, now I take a (password-protected & encrypted) [SuperDuper!](https://shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html) backup drive with me and put it in the hotel room safe when I travel with my laptop. 

My other ([Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com), etc) local &mdash;and also protected/encrypted&mdash; backups stay put at the home/office (in a fire safe). 

I still have access to my (also encrypted) off-site backups, but in the case of a total failure it is valuable to have something on-hand --and not be at the mercy of hotel/conference WiFi for-- to restore from and get back to work with as quickly as possible. 

Anybody else have redundant, neurotic, and/or secure backup schemes like this?
