Just read about a local `DPC` medical clinic. Sounds like an interesting approach. [Story on 614](http://614columbus.com/2017/12/a-primary-goal/) I wonder how some needs —like hospital stays, cancer treatments— are best handled with a plan like that. Probably still need separate, long-term/emergency coverage of some kind.
