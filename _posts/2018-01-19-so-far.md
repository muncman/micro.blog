This has been a crazy busy year so far. I've been doing tons, but I'm still way behind on my list. I've had maybe one full-day off from anything business-related since Christmas. 

One consequence is that I have not really gotten started blogging here. 

So, I'm taking next week off from client work. No billable hours, but I need the time. 

If I'm able, I'll try to write up a full & proper post. Or, at least, a non-micro post.
