Oh man. I&rsquo;ve been hoping for this. 

For many years, I&rsquo;ve been using a Mardown+Dropbox-based system for daily notes, particularly for business-related journaling (I guess you could call it that). 

[Notational Velocity](http://notational.net), [nvAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/), and more recently [The Archive](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/) have been my workhorses on macOS, with [1Writer](http://1writerapp.com) and other Dropbox-enabled apps on the iOS side. It has been a _great system_. 

I imagine I&rsquo;d use Drafts for iOS more than I do if it were not for this. 

I&rsquo;ve obviously used various client apps over time, so iCloud sync vs Dropbox is probably the key factor for me to consider once [this is released](https://vimeo.com/285326696). (Unless Drafts adopts Dropbox support as part of the move to Mac, of course &mdash; though I&rsquo;d be surprised if it did.)
