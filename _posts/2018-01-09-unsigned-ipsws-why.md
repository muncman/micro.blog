I cannot tell you how annoyed I am right now that Apple explicitly prevents you from downgrading iOS. 

It's _my_ device. I kept it on 10.3.3 for testing purposes. Until today when I went brain dead long enough to update it. Now, I'm unable to properly test changes for my current client, *and* this could be an obstacle to acquiring a new client. 

I just want one major version back. Just one.
