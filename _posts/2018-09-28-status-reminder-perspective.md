I started a new contract earlier this month, and have been working a lot, learning a lot, and enjoying it. I’m still working with Swift, but also adding (or, in some cases, dusting off) other skills — which was a primary goal for myself this year. 

But I’ve also been almost entirely off social media as a result. 

This has happened before, but it is a reminder that when I am engaged enough in other things, I don’t really miss it.
