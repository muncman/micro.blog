I have become much better at iPhone repair than I would ever have anticipated, but I still lean on [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com) guides every time I void a(n expired) warranty. In fact, I probably owe my relative comfort with the process to iFixit in the first place. 

I didn't get this way from fixing my own phones, mind you, but from maintaining the hand-me-downs we've gifted to the kids; screens, in particular. Just last night I swapped a display assembly from a retired iPhone 5s (that had charging issues) onto my son's current 5s. 

I've also performed surgery on --and upgrades to-- the family Mac mini using iFixit guides many times over the years. At one point, I bought their 64-bit driver toolkit, and it has been worth every penny.
