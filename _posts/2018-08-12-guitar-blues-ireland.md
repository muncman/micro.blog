If you are either a guitar player or love the blues, and you are not familiar with Gary Moore, then DO NOT WAIT ANY LONGER! Do yourself a _serious_ favor and check his recordings out. 

Suggestion: start with “Still Got the Blues.”

Rory Gallagher is another **fantastic** Irish bluesman, as well, if you want more.
