4 days into a contract-to-hire gig. Getting rolling while keeping an eye on factors for the eventual decision of if Iâ€™ll want to sign on full-time here. 

Today is also the 6th anniversary of going out on my own as an independent consultant, which seems extra noteworthy given my current headspace. 

What will I decide to do?
