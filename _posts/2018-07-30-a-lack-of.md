“Our records show that you are an IT professional with experience in . Net Developer .” 

I can immediately tell this is a recruiter who cares. 

This is especially obvious since they are giving me credit for experience in a technology I don’t have. They are on my side, pulling for me. They clearly have faith in me. And they like spaces in their templated emails, to boot!
