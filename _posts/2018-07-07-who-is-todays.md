**Where is all of the angry political music I thought we'd be enjoying by now?** 

When the band Havok released [this furious song](https://youtu.be/2HYIfA3p8jw) on the day of Trump's inauguration, I thought it would be the first of many. They followed next month with [this apropos song](https://youtu.be/2GT9m0jX9vw), and the [Prophets of Rage](https://youtu.be/asP2BHnyUTo) did their thing, but where are the other bands? 

Between climate change, BLM, Trump, Brexit, MeToo, reinvigorated racism, gun violence, _and more_, there's **plenty** to be raging about.
