I spent a good while today playing a really nice guitar at Rudyâ€™s Music Soho. One of their Pensa customs. It is a _very_ nice guitar. 

Itâ€™s also $7200, so I didnâ€™t get it. 

But next time I come here, Iâ€™ll probably play it or one like it again. 

Third trip from now, maybe Iâ€™ll have saved some (serious) coin for it. ðŸ¤¤
