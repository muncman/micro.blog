I got to see the [New Bomb Turks](http://newbombturks.com/) again tonight. It had been way too long! Lots of reminiscing going on in my head as a result. 

Most of the [NBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Bomb_Turks?wprov=sfti1) shows I went to were in the early 90s. IIRC, they had new singles through Datapanik (shout out to [Used Kids](http://www.usedkidsrecords.com/)) when I became a fan, but either way [!!Destroy Oh Boy!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/!!Destroy-Oh-Boy!!?wprov=sfti1) is still my favorite LP of theirs. 

You may not have heard of them, but more have than you might expect (worldwide). 

Fun, bold, exuberant, energetic punk music speaks to many, including me.
