I've been trying out [Supertop](http://supertop.co/)'s [Castro 3](http://supertop.co/castro/), and **it is nice!** Looks nice, feels nice, performs nice. _But nice enough for me to switch from [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/)?_ 

I currently have some of my own uploads ([Appendix 2 of The History of Rome](https://revolutionspodcastfundraiser.com/collections/thor-episodes)) queued up in Overcast (which is a Premium feature). I don't think I can do that with Castro, though maybe they'll implement something like that someday (or, maybe someday [Marco](https://marco.org/) will yank that feature. :) 

I often listen to my Overcast queue on the web via an [SSB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-specific_browser) on desktop (available because I have not 'converted to anonymous' in the app). I don&rsquo;t see any way to log in to Castro.fm to do the same, though. Since the only ID-related/sync-ish option seems to be to enable an iCloud backup (SOME-GUID.castrobackup), perhaps they could do something with CloudKit down the road for this? 

Another place I process my episode queue is on my iPad. While the aforementioned Castro backup does get nicely processed at launch on iPad, the app interface is scaled (side note: the backup was also not up to date when I tried it). Overcast, on the other hand, takes advantage of landscape orientation and multitasking. 

Given these differences, I&rsquo;ll be sticking with Overcast for the time being.

Footnote/Photo:  Speaking of time, at the bottom of the settings screen in Overcast it says how much time _Smart Speed_ has saved me. 193 hours is nothing to sneeze at!
