I started this reply directly in Twitter, but then decided to post this here since I’m not really a fan of Tweetstorms. Still, I left it composed for numbered 140-character-or-less chunks. In the end, I didn’t want to over-compose my reply even though I have more room to do so here. _\<shrug /\>_

**Background:** Eric is my friend, but we don’t see eye-to-eye on some things. :) I believe (hope!) he knows that I’m not trying to be belligerent. I enjoy having discussions with people who hold viewpoints different from my own. Of course, Twitter is simply **not good** for this. 

[Here’s the conversation so far](http://storify.com/muncman/discussion-from-twitterrific-59bb65f863699d6d1ebd5827). You’ll have to read his 12-part response to my own prior reply for the context of what follows. 

_**My response:**_

/1 _Everything_ is loaded on Twitter. :) 

/2 Your response also uses loaded terms, such as the (mis-)use of 'gender' as if it was fully equivalent to biological/assigned ‘sex’. 

/3 Or applying a moral judgement on 'viability' that is orthogonal to scientific (and other) aspects of the matters you reference. 

/4 I lol'd at the characterization of evolution as atheist mythology (as if it is on the same footing as creationism). 

/5 The 'macro' angle you specify tells me that you probably recognize at least some of the truth of it. 

/6 To the original point, the resonance of this topic for me is around human tendency to damage the natural world (or, if you prefer, creation). 

/7 Climate change-denial in general, and this administration (and so, too, its party) in particular, are forces for perpetuating this damage. 

/8 Is climate change being used as a political tool? Surely. But the politicians should debate *that*, not deny the science (complex or not).
